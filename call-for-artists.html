                    <h3>INFORMATION FOR ARTISTS</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are seeking submissions from Toronto and GTA artists who have been affected by the prison and judicial system, either personally through their own incarceration, or through the experience of a friend, family, or community member. All artistic practices will be considered for submission, including but not limited to digital media, sculpture, painting, spoken or written word, and others. Artworks will be selected by the curators and representatives from each of the projects' partners. Selected artists will have their original works in the exhibition and successful applicants will be paid an honorarium per applicable CARFAC fees, with the option to sell their work in the exhibited space to earn extra income through the project. Deadline for submissions is September 6th, 2021.
                    </p>
