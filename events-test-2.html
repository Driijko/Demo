            This workshop will look at documentary filmmaking as a journaling medium. As a group, we will play a series of games with the hopes of gently lifting the veil on our lives. The goal, by the end of the workshop, is for participants to have a blueprint for a short diary film. Roberto's films are informed by methods of coping, and the human activities in which communities engage to ease pain and the disquiet of the mind.

                <i>Health and Harm Reduction Inside of Canadian Prisons</i> will explore the impacts of unequal access to health care and harm reduction measures that prisoners face across Turtle Island. We will also look at how COVID-19 has stressed the carceral system in unprecedented ways and how this pandemic has manifested in creating great harm to people inside. A discussion of an article in Cell Count, a health and harm reduction resource for prisoners, will then take place to look at the experiences and mindset of someone who has been carrying out a life sentence to create further understanding of the prison experience. Participants will discuss ways that people on the outside can be in solidarity with those fighting for their rights on the inside.
