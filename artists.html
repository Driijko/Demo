              <strong>Chad Potvin</strong> is a visual artist. Art to him in jail is his mental escape. When he’s drawing, nothing else matters and he’s able to just tune out the world of jail. Art is his escape. It helps him keep his mind strong because drawing uses lots of brain power. While he was in the federal system, he tattooed and his art paid for his food. He is a self taught tattooist and one day he would love to be known as one of the greats in the tattoo world. He also used to sit down with some lifer friends, hang out, draw, and rack their brains for ways to become better. Now after a decade of drawing he still believes. Art is about the joy he brings to the world.
